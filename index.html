    <h1>Meeshkan</h1>
    <p>Hi, we're Meeshkan, and we're building a fake version of the internet.</p>
    <h1>News</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>We were granted our <b>first patent</b> for a distributed machine learning algorithm. The algorithm cuts costs significantly compared to traditional single-tenant methods. We've used this algorithm internally to build corners of the fake internet in a distributed fashion.</li>
      <li>Our open-source engineer Carolyn Stransky caused quite a stir with <b><a href="https://dev.to/meeshkan/how-to-remove-condescending-language-from-documentation-4a5p">this article</a></b>. We're proud of you, Carolyn. Keep up the good work!</li>
      <li>We're honored to have made first place in the 2019 <b>Helsinki's Hottest Startup</b> list by <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/best-startups-in-helsinki-2019
          ">Wired magazine</a>.</li>
      <li>We closed a <b>EUR 1.8 million investment round</b> from <a href="https://www.connectventures.co/">Connect Ventures</a>, <a href="http://www.systemone.vc/">System One</a>, <a href="https://www.nordicmakers.vc/">Nordic Makers</a>, <a href="http://tiny.vc/">Tiny VC</a>, <a href="http://www.firstfellow.com/">First Fellow</a>, <a href="https://www.futuristic.vc">Futuristic</a> and <a href="https://angel.co/jermyap">Jeremy Yap</a>.</li>
