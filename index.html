    <h1>Meeshkan</h1>
    <p>Hi, we're Meeshkan, and we build digital twins.</p>
    <h1>News</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>We were granted our <b>first patent</b> for a distributed machine learning algorithm. The algorithm cuts costs significantly compared to traditional single-tenant methods. We've used this algorithm internally to build corners of the fake internet in a distributed fashion.</li>
      <li>Our open-source engineer Carolyn Stransky caused quite a stir with <b><a href="https://dev.to/meeshkan/how-to-remove-condescending-language-from-documentation-4a5p">this article</a></b>. We're proud of you, Carolyn. Keep up the good work!</li>
      <li>The <b>Unmock Orb</b> is now live on <a href="https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/unmock/unmock">CircleCI</a>. It is a fast and free way to mock REST APIs in their CI/CD pipelines. Hats off to Kimmo Sääskilahti for building it.</li>
      <li>We're honored to have made first place in the 2019 <b>Helsinki's Hottest Startup</b> list by <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/best-startups-in-helsinki-2019
          ">Wired magazine</a>.</li>
      <li>We closed a <b>EUR 1.8 million investment round</b> from <a href="https://www.connectventures.co/">Connect Ventures</a>, <a href="http://www.systemone.vc/">System One</a>, <a href="https://www.nordicmakers.vc/">Nordic Makers</a>, <a href="http://tiny.vc/">Tiny VC</a>, <a href="http://www.firstfellow.com/">First Fellow</a>, <a href="https://www.futuristic.vc">Futuristic</a> and <a href="https://angel.co/jermyap">Jeremy Yap</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What's a digital twin?</h1>
      <p>A digital twin is a clone of a server, database, or connected device such as a car or appliance. Digital twins are useful for testing, prototyping, and experimentation.</p>
    <h1>Learn</h1>
      <p>Download our <a>whitepaper</a> and read about some of our <a>customer success stories</a>.  You can also take <a>this survey</a> to determine if your product or service could benefit from a digital twin.  If you'd like to know more, please <a>reach out</a><a>.</a></p>
    <h1>Jobs</h1>
      <p>We will hire our next batch of Meeshkanites in Q1 2020. In the meantime, if you would like to be part of the adventure, we always welcome free-form applications <a href="mailto:jobs@meeshkan.com">here</a>.</p>
    <h1>Open source</h1>
      <p>We contribute to or lead development in over 100 Open Source projects. Your contributions are welcome. Join our <a href="https://gitter.im/unmock/community">Gitter</a> or check out some of our <a href="https://github.com/unmock">repos</a> for more information.</p>
